## Introduction:
In this article, you will delve into the fascinating world of vehicular cybersecurity. We will explore an in-depth investigation of Replay and Relay attacks, which affect vehicles and utilize radiofrequency waves as a communication channel. We will learn how these attacks can endanger the security of automobiles and how we can effectively protect ourselves against them. Additionally, we will discover an innovative and secure solution to face these challenges.

## Study Phases

1. **Introduction to the World of Electromagnetic Communications**
To grasp the concepts that will be addressed later, it is essential to understand the fundamentals related to telecommunications, the electromagnetic spectrum, and the radio spectrum. We will learn how these issues arise in the vehicular context.

2. **Investigating Replay and Relay Attacks**
We will delve into the current state of these attacks in the context of automobiles. We will analyze how hackers exploit vulnerabilities in radiofrequency waves to carry out malicious actions.

3. **HackRF One: The Device for Capturing and Replicating Radiofrequency Signals**
We will discover in detail the HackRF One device, which is fundamental for executing these attacks. We will learn how to update its drivers and resolve potential locking issues.

4. **Exploring the Portapack H2**
The HackRF One device requires specific software to send and receive radiofrequency signals. Here, we will explore the Portapack H2, a portable accessory that provides autonomy. We will analyze how to integrate it with the HackRF One and explore different drivers available for this device.

5. **Proposed Solution**
The crucial moment in this study is to propose an effective solution to counter Replay and Relay attacks. We will detail this solution through frequency diagrams and address each problem identified in the investigation. Additionally, we will develop Python software that will implement the system in practice. We will conduct comprehensive tests to demonstrate that our system is secure against current attacks.

## Conclusions
Vehicular cybersecurity is a growing concern in the modern world. With this study, we have understood the challenges that vehicles face with Replay and Relay attacks. Furthermore, we have learned how the HackRF One device and the Portapack H2 can be used by hackers to carry out these attacks. Most importantly, we have presented a robust solution to counter these threats and protect our vehicles from potential malicious attacks. Security is a priority, and with the right tools and knowledge, we can defend our vehicular networks against any intrusion attempts. A safer future awaits us with cybersecurity as our ally!
