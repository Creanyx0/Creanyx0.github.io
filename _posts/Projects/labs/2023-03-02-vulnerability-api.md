Welcome to the fascinating world of VulnerabilityAPI! This impressive REST API is specifically designed to help you learn about vulnerabilities affecting modern web applications. Currently, we are focused on exploring the dreaded SQL Injection. Each vulnerability is hosted in a controller that showcases the development of an insecure form and, of course, its secure counterpart with the implemented solution. You can make requests to different parts of the code to debug and observe how the vulnerability behaves. But that's not all, the adventure doesn't end here! Our team is committed to expanding this platform by adding new vulnerabilities in the future. So stay tuned, because soon you'll be able to explore and understand other security challenges affecting modern web applications. Get ready to face all the challenges and strengthen your pentesting skills like never before!
