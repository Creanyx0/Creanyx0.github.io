```
reconftw.py whois -d <IP>
```

4. **Email Harvesting**: The tool can search for email addresses on websites and public sources. For example:

```
reconftw.py email -d <IP>
```

5. IP Address to Domain Mapping: Reconftw can identify domain names associated with IP addresses. For example:

```
reconftw.py ip2domain -i <IP>
```

6. Technology and Version Detection: The tool can detect the technologies and versions used in services and applications. For example:

```
reconftw.py technologies -t <IP>
```
