## Information about the Network

There are commands that are used to display the network configuration information of a computer. This commands provide details such as the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and other network-related settings for each active network adapter on the system.

> Command for Windows systems:

```
ipconfig
```

> Command for Linux systems:

```
ifconfig
```

Other option (with iproute2):

```
ip address
```



## Discovering Hosts in the Network

> **Netdiscover** is a command that is used to discover the internal IP address and MAC address of live hosts in the network.

Syntax:

```
netdiscover -r <range>
```

Example:

```
netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
```

> Other option, with fping:

```
fping -asgq <range>
```



## Port Scan, Service Enumeration and Vulnerability Detection

**nmap** is a tool to scan ports, services and vulnerabilities on a specific IP or range of network.

> Syntax:

```
nmap <scanType> <options> <IP> --script <scriptNames>
```

> Example:

```
nmap -sS -sV -p- 192.168.1.34 --script auth,vuln,default
```

> Other example:

```
nmap -sS -sV -sC -p- 192.168.1.34
```

In Nmap, the parameter "-sC" is used to enable the default NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) scripts. NSE scripts are a powerful feature of Nmap that allows users to perform various tasks beyond simple port scanning. These scripts can be used for vulnerability detection, service enumeration, and more.



## Basic commands

> Command used to obtain the current user's name interacting with the operating system.

Linux and Windows:

```
whoami
```

> Command is used to display the current user's identity and group membership on a Unix-like operating system.

Linux:

```
id
```

Windows:

```
whoami
```

> Command used to displays the list of commands that the current user is allowed to run with superuser privileges (root) as configured in the sudoers file and the privileges that the current user has:

Linux:

```
sudo -l
```

Windows:

```
whoami /priv
```

> Command used to list the files and directories in the current directory

Linux:

```
ls -lisa
```

Windows:

```
dir
```

> Command used to display the contents of a text file

Linux

```
cat <name-file.txt>
```

Windows

```
type <name-file.txt>
```

> Command to find a text, for example, to find a flag

Command examples:

```
find . -name "*flag.txt"
```

```
grep -r "HTB"
```

> Command to list of previously executed commands

Linux:

```
history
```

Windows:

``` powershell
PS > Get-History
```



## Banner Discovery: Revealing Service Details

The banner of a service is a brief description or information provided by the service when a client connects to it. This information is displayed in the initial header of the communication protocol and can reveal important details about the running service.

It can be useful to know versions of services or check which service is being executed on that port.

> It can be known with an NMAP Script:

```
nmap -sV --script=banner <IP>
```

> Syntax with Netcat:

```
nc -nv <IP> <port>
```

> Syntax with Telnet:

```
telnet <IP> <port>
```
