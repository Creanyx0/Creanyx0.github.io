## Description

A Command and Control (C2) in pentesting is a system or infrastructure that allows pentesters to remotely control and coordinate compromised devices during a penetration test. It facilitates the management and handling of compromised systems, enabling specific actions and attacks to be carried out centrally. The C2 is an essential component in penetration testing to maintain control of compromised systems and execute specific actions according to the pentester's objectives or the security team's requirements.
